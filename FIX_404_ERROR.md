# 🔧 Fix GitHub 404 Error

The 404 error means the repository doesn't exist on GitHub yet.

---

## 🎯 Solution - Create the Repository First!

You've already added the remote URL:

```
https://github.com/mnafeel/restaurant-pos-system.git
```

But the repository doesn't exist yet on GitHub!

---

## ✅ **OPTION 1: Create Repository on GitHub** (Recommended)

### **Step 1: Go to GitHub**

Open in browser: **https://github.com/new**

### **Step 2: Fill in Details**

- **Owner:** mnafeel (should be auto-selected)
- **Repository name:** `restaurant-pos-system` (EXACT name)
- **Description:** "Professional Restaurant POS System"
- **Visibility:**
  - ✅ **Private** (Recommended - only you see it)
  - Or Public
- **DO NOT** check:
  - ❌ Add a README file
  - ❌ Add .gitignore
  - ❌ Choose a license

### **Step 3: Create Repository**

Click the green **"Create repository"** button

### **Step 4: Push Your Code**

Now run this command:

```bash
cd /Users/admin/restaurant-billing-system
git push -u origin main
```

**That's it!** The 404 error will be gone! ✅

## 🔐 **Authentication**

When Git asks for credentials:

**Username:** `mnafeel`

**Password:** **Use Personal Access Token** (NOT your GitHub password)

### **Get Personal Access Token:**

1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click: **"Generate new token"** → **"Generate new token (classic)"**
3. Fill in:
   - **Note:** "Restaurant POS Upload"
   - **Expiration:** 90 days (or No expiration)
   - **Select scopes:** ✅ **repo** (check this box - full control of private repositories)
4. Scroll down → Click: **"Generate token"**
5. **COPY THE TOKEN** (looks like: ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxx...)
6. **Save it somewhere** (you won't see it again!)

### **Use the Token:**

When Git asks for password:

```
Username: mnafeel
Password: [PASTE YOUR TOKEN HERE]
```

**⚠️ Important:** Paste the TOKEN, not your GitHub account password!

## 🔄 **OPTION 2: Change Repository Name**

If you want a different name:

```bash
cd /Users/admin/restaurant-billing-system

# Remove current remote
git remote remove origin

# Add new remote with different name
git remote add origin https://github.com/mnafeel/YOUR-NEW-NAME.git

# Then create repository with that EXACT name on GitHub
```

---

## ⚡ **Quick Fix Steps:**

```bash
# 1. Create repository on GitHub
# → Go to: https://github.com/new
# → Name: restaurant-pos-system
# → Click: Create repository

# 2. Push your code
cd /Users/admin/restaurant-billing-system
git push -u origin main

# 3. Enter credentials
# Username: mnafeel
# Password: [YOUR PERSONAL ACCESS TOKEN]
```

## ❌ **Common Errors:**

### **Error: "Repository not found"**

- **Cause:** Repository doesn't exist on GitHub
- **Fix:** Create it first at https://github.com/new

### **Error: "Authentication failed"**

- **Cause:** Using GitHub password instead of token
- **Fix:** Use Personal Access Token

### **Error: "Permission denied"**

- **Cause:** Wrong username or token doesn't have repo permission
