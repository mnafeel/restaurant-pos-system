## 🔐 Important Security Notes

### **Before Making Repository Public:**

If you choose to make your repository **Public**, first:

1. **Remove sensitive files:**

   ```bash
   # Remove files with passwords/credentials
   rm CURRENT_PASSWORDS.txt
   rm ALL_USERS_PASSWORDS.txt
   rm CREDENTIALS.txt
   rm LOGIN_CREDENTIALS.txt

   # Commit the removal
   git add .
   git commit -m "Remove sensitive files"
   ```

2. **Change default passwords** in the code
3. **Use environment variables** for secrets
4. **Review all files** for sensitive information

### **For Private Repository:**

- No need to remove files
- Only you (and invited collaborators) can see the code
- Database and passwords are safe

---

## 💡 Helpful Commands

```bash
# Check repository status
git status

# View commit history
git log --oneline

# See what's changed
git diff

# Undo changes (before commit)
git checkout -- filename

# View remote repository
git remote -v

# Pull latest changes (if working on multiple computers)
git pull origin main
```
