## 🔐 Data Isolation Implementation

### Shop ID Filtering Applied to ALL Endpoints:

#### 1. **Menu Items** (`/api/menu`)

```javascript
// Filters menu items by shop_id
WHERE (m.shop_id = ${userShopId} OR m.shop_id IS NULL)
```

- Shop 1 adds "Chicken Fry" → Only visible to Shop 1
- Shop 2 adds "Beef Burger" → Only visible to Shop 2
- ✅ No data mixing between shops

#### 2. **Tables** (`/api/tables`)

```javascript
// Filters tables by shop_id
WHERE shop_id = ${userShopId} OR shop_id IS NULL
```

- Each shop manages only their own tables
- Table numbers can be reused across shops

#### 3. **Orders** (`/api/orders`, `/api/orders/pending`)

```javascript
// All orders tagged with shop_id on creation
INSERT INTO orders (..., shop_id) VALUES (..., req.user.shop_id)

// Pending orders filtered by shop
WHERE o.payment_status = 'pending' AND (o.shop_id = ${userShopId} OR o.shop_id IS NULL)
```

- Orders belong to specific shop
- Only that shop can view/edit their orders

#### 4. **Bills** (`/api/bills`)

```javascript
// Bills inherit shop_id from order
shop_id = order.shop_id;
```

- Bills automatically linked to shop
- Revenue tracked per shop

#### 5. **Reports** (All `/api/reports/*`)

```javascript
// Sales Report
WHERE (b.shop_id = ${userShopId} OR b.shop_id IS NULL)

// Top Items
AND (b.shop_id = ${userShopId} OR b.shop_id IS NULL)

// Daily Payments
AND (shop_id = ${userShopId} OR shop_id IS NULL)
```

- Each shop sees only their own analytics
- Revenue, orders, items all isolated

#### 6. **Kitchen Display** (`/api/kitchen/orders`)

```javascript
// Kitchen orders filtered by shop
AND (o.shop_id = ${userShopId} OR o.shop_id IS NULL)
```

- Chefs see only their shop's orders
- No cross-shop order visibility

## 📊 Database Schema

### All Tables with `shop_id` Column:

```sql
users           → shop_id (staff belongs to shop)
menu_items      → shop_id (menu isolated per shop)
tables          → shop_id (tables isolated per shop)
orders          → shop_id (orders isolated per shop)
bills           → shop_id (revenue isolated per shop)
```

### How It Works:

**On Creation:**

```javascript
// User creates menu item
shop_id = req.user.shop_id; // Auto-tagged

// Admin takes order
shop_id = req.user.shop_id; // Auto-tagged

// System generates bill
shop_id = order.shop_id; // Inherited
```

**On Retrieval:**

```javascript
// Get menu items
WHERE shop_id = ${userShopId} OR shop_id IS NULL

// Get orders
WHERE shop_id = ${userShopId} OR shop_id IS NULL

// Get reports
WHERE shop_id = ${userShopId} OR shop_id IS NULL
```
