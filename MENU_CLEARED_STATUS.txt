✅ Deleted ALL orphaned menu items
✅ Deleted menu variants
✅ Vacuumed database
✅ Now: 0 menu items in database

========================================
CURRENT DATABASE STATE:

HOW CLEAR MENU WORKS NOW:
========================================

✅ Proper Flow:

1. Shop admin adds menu items
   → Items saved with shop_id = 2

2. Owner views shop menu
   → Sees items for that shop

3. Owner clears menu
   → DELETE WHERE shop_id = 2
   → Matches items correctly
   → Items deleted from database ✓
